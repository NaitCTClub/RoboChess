# RoboChess
C# .Net using WPF

a Chess game that bots play

We are long way from AI computers, but that is the end goal.

At this point you are able to play 1v1 with another human on the same pc, 
Or against a bot of your making.. Sooooo exciting.

GETTING STARTED
1. Download the RoboChess Folder
2. Open the Chess.sln file in the first layer of the folder.
3. Edit the Bot_YourBot.cs File to your liking (Read the comments)
4. Run the program to play with your new Bot!
